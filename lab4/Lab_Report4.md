I used `<tab>` to help me fill the rest of the respository/file name l for lab7, t for test.sh

Explanation: I opened the `vim` text editor to check and fix the error in the file, and here I also used   
`<tab>` after L and added `.java` to complete the `ListExample.java` file name. The instruction said   
I need to change `index1` into `index2` on the indicated line. Therefore, I used the find command by   
pressing `/index1` and `enter` to find the first `index1` occurrence and used 8 times of `n` to find   
the `index1` I needed. Then I pressed `e` to jump to the last character in the `index1`, and `r` and   
`2` to open the replace mode and replace the last character `1` to `2`. Afterall, I pressed `<Esc>` to   
go back to normal mode and pressed `:wq!` to save and quit the file.    
Key Pressed: `vim <space> <Shift + l> <tab> .java <enter>`     
Key Pressed(vim): `/index1 <enter> n n n n n n n n n e r 2 <Esc> <Shift +;> wq <enter>`
