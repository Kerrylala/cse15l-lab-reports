Hi, I am trying to finish lab4. Therefore, I logged in my ieng6-203 with
`ssh hugu@ieng6-203.ucsd.edu` and clone the repository that forked. Then I `cd` the path to lab7.     
However,when I tried to run the test with `bash test.sh`, it said initialization error.   
At first, I thought it's the  error that come with the ListExample.java,   
so I changed the `index1` to     
`index2`, but I found out that it's not the problem. Then I checked the   
`test.sh` code, by changing the code of `:` from mac to `;` from windows,   
there are more errors received. I think it's caused by the incorrect version of  
junit, but still I don't know how to correct it.
