handleRequest(URI url) method of the Handler class is called. The argument to the handleRequest method is a URI object with the value http://localhost:2100/add-message?s=I%20don%27t%20know%20the%20password&user=wifi.
The relevant fields are chat for storing the chat history and user and message variables which are parsed from the query parameters. The chat string is appended with the new message formatted as user: message\n, which in this case would be wifi: I don't know the password\n.
